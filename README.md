# USING-DDL-Commands-ON-MY SQL
This is my first project on MYSQL 

# Overview

This project demonstrates the use of Data Definition Language (DDL) commands in MySQL to create, modify, and manage the structure of a relational database. It showcases the process of designing and implementing database schemas, including tables, constraints, and relationships, to support efficient data storage and retrieval.

# Features

Database Creation: Set up a database for  a school

1. Table Design: Define tables with appropriate data types, primary keys, and foreign keys.

2. Constraints Implementation: Apply constraints such as NOT NULL, UNIQUE, CHECK, and DEFAULT to ensure data integrity.

3. Schema Modification: Demonstrate the use of ALTER statements to modify existing table structures.

4. Table Deletion: Safely drop tables and clean up schemas when no longer needed. 

# Key DDL Commands Used

1. CREATE: Define new databases, tables, and constraints.

2. ALTER: Modify table structures by adding or removing columns and constraints.

3. DROP: Delete tables or databases.

4. TRUNCATE: Remove all records from a table without affecting its structure.

5. RENAME : Renames the  current selected Table

# Project Structure

Database Schema Design-
Tables:  Roll_No, Name ,Marks, Grade ,Contact 

# SQL Scripts:

create_schema.sql: Script to create the database and its tables.

alter_schema.sql: Script to demonstrate schema modifications.

drop_schema.sql: Script to clean up the database.

# How to Use

1. Clone this repository

git clone : https://github.com/MohammedYazin-N/MySQL-DDL-Commands-Project

2. Import the SQL scripts into your MySQL environment using a client like MySQL Workbench or the MySQL command line.

3. Run the scripts in the following order for a full demonstration:

create_schema.sql

alter_schema.sql

drop_schema.sql

# Requirements

1. MySQL Server: Version 8.0
2. SQL Client: MySQL Workbench or any command-line client.

   
# Learning Outcomes

Through this project, you will:

Gain hands-on experience with MySQL DDL commands.

Understand how to design and modify relational database schemas.

Learn best practices for maintaining data integrity and consistency.

# Future Enhancements

Integration with DML (Data Manipulation Language) operations for data insertion and querying.

Advanced constraint demonstrations, such as cascading updates and deletes.

Example use cases for the designed schema in real-world applications.
